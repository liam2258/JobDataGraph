# JobDataGraph

Using the data created by the JobWebScraper (https://github.com/liam2258/JobWebScraper) this script transforms the data into 3 graphs using pandas and plotly.
A choropleth graph that shows job listings by the amount in each state.

A pie chart that shows what percentage of job listings mention the each programming language.
